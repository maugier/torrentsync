TorrentSync 0.1
===============

TorrentSync aims to behave similarly to rsync, but with added cleverness when
syncing torrents. It is useful when two hosts hold a partial copy of the same
torrent, and you want one of the hosts to help the other complete its copy.

If the source host has the complete torrent, or if its copy is stricly more
complete than the other (i.e. the source host has all the pieces that the
destination host have, and mode), there is no need for a special tool. Just
use rsync.

However, if the destination host has pieces that the source does not, then using
rsync may overwrite good pieces with invalid data. TorrentSync will avoid
that, using the information in the .torrent file to synchronize only pieces that are good on the source and bad on the destination.

Overview:
  - benc    : translate b-encoded data to erlang terms
  - torrent : read and parse a torrent file using benc, access to the various
              torrent fields
  - pad_reader : abstraction layer to pad incomplete, trunctated files when
                 reading
  - loader     : load pieces from a torrent at a given location
  - checker    : hash pieces, report good and bad pieces
  - differ     : receive pieces from the source, receive piece requests from
                 the destination and send them back
  
  - store : receive pieces and writes them to disk
  - tsync : plumbing and test wrappers
